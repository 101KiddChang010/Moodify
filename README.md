# Setting Up the Ngrok Server
Moodify uses Ngrok to host our application. 

- Ngrok can be hosted on a local or virtual machine, but these 
instructions will be specific to hosting it on a local physical machine
- The Ngrok server must be running in order to use the facial mood detection feature of Moodify

## Step 1. Create an account
To use Ngrok you need to create an account

- Go to https://ngrok.com/
- Click "Sign up" in the top right corner
- Enter your information and click "Sign up"
- Verify your email if asked to do so
- Fill out the questionnaire

## Step 2. Grabbing the Authtoken
Ngrok provides you with an Authtoken. This is used to authenticate the ngrok agent that you will download in step 3. Make sure to keep it handy, as we will use it in step 4.


## Step 3. Download Ngrok
- Go to this link: https://ngrok.com/download
- Click your respective "OS" Agent (e.g. macOS, Windows, Linux...) 
- Download Ngrok through whichever method you prefer

## Step 4. Configuring your authtoken
- After downloading Ngrok, From Step 2. grab your authtoken and configure it with ngrok through the terminal by running this command
```terminal
ngrok config add-authtoken <token>
```

## Step 5. Setting up Ngrok in the Terminal
- Run this command in the terminal to run ngrok
```terminal
ngrok http 8080
```
- It should look like this

- Everytime you run ngrok again, you have to grab the new url and put it in the "homePageView.swift".

- This is the new url to be used from the previous example https://58db-23-117-48-87.ngrok.free.app

## Step 6. Updating homePageView.swift
- Update this line in homePageView.swift based on what your url is (we're using the example from step 5. in this case)
```swift
struct homePageView: View {
    ...
    let backendURL = "https://58db-23-117-48-87.ngrok-free.app/analyze"
    ...
```
- Ensure you add /analyze to the end of the link, exactly as shown above

## Step 7. Setting up + Running the Virtual Environment
- You must be in the flask folder/directory in order to build the virtual environment
- Run this command in a seperate terminal to build the virtual env
```terminal
python3 -m venv deepface-env
```

- Run this command in the flask folder to activate the virtual env
```terminal
source deepface-env/bin/activate
```

- It should look like this

## Step 8. Install the needed Packages in the virtual environment
- Install flask
```terminal
pip install flask
```

- Install deepface
```terminal
pip install deepface
```

- Install tf-keras
```terminal
pip install tf-keras
```

## Step 9. Running the flas.py file
- Run this command for the flask file (Note: flask.py doesn't work as a filename since it interferes with the flask library)
```terminal
python3 flas.py
```

## Step 10. Final Result
- Then you should have 2 separate terminals which should look like the following:
    - One running Ngrok (top terminal)
    - The other running flas.py (bottom terminal)

# Set up Spotify Services

- Login with your Spotify Premium account
- If you are a developer looking to test the application, but do not have
  a Spotify Premium account you can use the following developer account

    - Click "Add"

- Click "Save"
- One the developer app has been created, click "Settings"
- Click "Edit"
- Enter "Moodify" for the iOS app bundle
    - Click "Add"
- Click "Save"

## Step 2. Add the Client ID to Moodify

- Press Command + F and search for "private let spotifyClientID"
- Paste your "Client ID" as a string after the = sign
- The final line of code should look like this:
```swift
